## About
Hi there, I’m a Software Engineer from Bangladesh. My journey began with QBASIC and C language at college. Then started to learn different languages like Visual Basic, Java, PHP, Golang, Javascript, and different software related technologies like VPS, docker, Kubernetes, micro-services, distributed system, etc. As I love Golang more than any other programming language, for now, most of the time I spent writing different services, packages in Go. I’m familiar with different PHP/JS/Golang libraries & frameworks like Laravel, Lumen, Codeigniter, jQuery, React, Vue.js, Gorilla mux, chi, echo, beego, etc. Spend almost 14 Hrs a day with different tech stack, contributing/reading open source projects, reading articles somewhere on the web. Always trying to learn “how to design better software”.
